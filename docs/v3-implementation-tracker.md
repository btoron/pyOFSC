**Status:** Completed  
**Acceptance Criteria Met:** 4/4
- ✅ Both sync and async clients initialize properly
- ✅ Context managers work correctly for resource management

  - Split Phase 1.4 from 6 tasks to 20 tasks across 5 subphases (1.4.0 to 1.4.4)
  - Focus on model reorganization and adaptation rather than rewriting
  - Existing models.py contains 64+ BaseModel classes that will be reused
  - Plan emphasizes backward compatibility and model submodule organization
- Track decisions and rationale here
- Document any deviations from the plan
- Record lessons learned

### Blockers and Dependencies
- List any blockers encountered
- Track external dependencies
