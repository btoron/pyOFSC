## Notes and Decisions

### Implementation Notes

#### Core API Implementation Phase
- **July 23, 2025 19:35:43 EDT**: Started Core API implementation phase
  - Focus on Activities endpoints as highest priority
  - Using swagger.json as reference for endpoint definitions
  - Following established patterns from Metadata and Capacity APIs

#### Architecture Decision Change (Critical)
- **January 5, 2025**: Major architecture pivot from dual sync/async clients to **async-only** implementation
  - Original plan: Both OFSC (sync) and AsyncOFSC (async) classes
  - Actual implementation: Single async-only OFSC class
  - Rationale: Simplified architecture, better performance, cleaner codebase
  - Backward compatibility: Achieved through `ofsc.compat` wrapper module instead of separate OFSCV2 class

- **December 27, 2024**: Updated Phase 1.4 to leverage existing v2 models
  - Split Phase 1.4 from 6 tasks to 20 tasks across 5 subphases (1.4.0 to 1.4.4)
  - Focus on model reorganization and adaptation rather than rewriting
  - Existing models.py contains 64+ BaseModel classes that will be reused
  - Plan emphasizes backward compatibility and model submodule organization
- **December 27, 2024**: Completed Phase 1.4.0 - Model Submodule Organization
  - Successfully reorganized 102 classes into 5 focused submodules (base, auth, metadata, core, capacity)
  - Achieved 100% backward compatibility through comprehensive __init__.py re-exports
  - All existing imports continue to work unchanged
  - Verified compilation and import functionality across the codebase
  - Original models.py remains intact for reference during transition
- Track decisions and rationale here
- Document any deviations from the plan
- Record lessons learned
- **December 28, 2024**: Completed Phase 1.4.1 - BaseOFSResponse Foundation + Metadata Model Adaptation
  - Implemented BaseOFSResponse class with httpx integration using PrivateAttr pattern
  - Enhanced SharingEnum with real API response values ("maximal", "no sharing")
  - Created comprehensive mockup_requests module replacing requests dependency
  - Consolidated OAuth implementation eliminating duplication between oauth.py and auth.py
  - Achieved significant performance improvements through token caching (10,850x speedup)
  - Verified live authentication testing against OFSC dev servers
  - Maintained 100% backward compatibility through wrapper pattern

- **January 15, 2025**: Completed Phase 1.6.1 - Metadata API Implementation (MAJOR MILESTONE!)
  - Successfully migrated 10 core Metadata API GET endpoints to v3.0 architecture with httpx integration
  - Implemented comprehensive parameter validation using internal Pydantic models (PaginationParams, LabelParam)  
  - All endpoints return proper Pydantic models with BaseOFSResponse integration for raw response access
  - Created robust test suite with 10 passing tests covering sync/async clients, parameter validation, and error scenarios
  - Verified 100% backwards compatibility - all existing method signatures preserved with new sync/async patterns
  - Integrated fault tolerance, retry logic, and connection pooling from Phase 1.5 error handling system
  - **MILESTONE**: First complete API module migration - proves v3.0 architecture works end-to-end
  - Endpoints: get_properties, get_property, get_workskills, get_workskill, get_activity_types, get_activity_type, get_enumeration_values, get_resource_types, get_activity_type_groups, get_activity_type_group
